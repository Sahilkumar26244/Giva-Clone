# Collaborative Project At Masai School “GIVA Jewellery Clone”.

Before, I start my blog writing on the clone of the Giva website, I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and life skills.
We have tried our level best to make use of our so far journey and the knowledge that we have gained so far at Masai School to come up with our first project.
Getting Started…
It was a challenging journey for me and all my team members as we have to complete it within the time of construct week, so we faced different challenges like it was our first project and we did not have any prior experience to working in a team and also we did not know how to manage everything within the time period. So we started with the planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow , roles and responsibilities and with great collaboration, we all managed the work.


## Project Details -

We had to make a clone of the GIVA Jewellery website.
GIVA Jewellery, known as Jewellery products and it is an Indian manufacturer and multi-level marketing company specializing in Jewellery products. A fields, creators of Proactive, started the website recently and sold it a year later. They relaunched the Jewellery as a multi-level marketing firm.

We have tried our best to clone the offical Giva website.
